        JWT (JSON WEB TOKEN)
JWT is mainly used for authorization purpose, not authentication.

Structure of jwt:
    •	HEADER	{“alg”: “HS256”, “type”: “JWT”}
    •	PAYLOAD	{“sub”:“1234567890”, “name”:”john doe”}
    •	SIGNATURE	  HMACSHA(BASE64URL (header)

JSON WEB TOKEN
    •	INDUSTRY STANDARD RFC 7519
    •	Securely transmits information between parties as a JSON object.
    •	Digitally signed.

How JWT works?
    1.	Client login with username and password.
    2.	Servers creates a token for the client.
    3.	Servers sends a token to the client.
    4.	Client stores the token on either local storage or browser cookie.
    5.	Next time the client makes a request, a copy of the token is send to the server of authorization.
    6.	Server verifies the JWT signature before giving the authorization.
    7.	Servers responds to the client’s request.
